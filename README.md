### Project Description
Our Touch-Me-Not Bot is pretty simple and straightforward. It is a poor bot that values it's personal space and doesn't like anyone(or anything for that matter!!) around it's proximity. It would blurt sligtly insulting dialogues when an object comes a bit close, and would scream heavy insults if anything comes too close to it.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We didn't face any interesting problems..so we added a new problem to this world!The most useless problem the world needed!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Oh wait...is our solution the problem? Oopsie:( 
What's more useless than a roast spitting bot! Our creative solution to a non-existent problem:))

### Project Documentation

1. Project Overview
Project Name:Touch me not
Objective: To create a robot that does absolutely nothing meaningful except deliver unwanted, randomly timed verbal jabs to anyone within range. Because why not?
Features:
Spits out random mild insults whenever it senses someone, ensuring it is almost never silent.
Flashes some LEDs to keep itself looking vaguely busy.
Designed to feel essential but contribute zero real value.
2. Project Requirements
Hardware Components:
Microcontroller: Necessary, apparently, to make the magic happen. But does it really?
Ultrasonic Sensor: Needed to detect when someone’s nearby, purely for initiating sarcastic remarks.
SD Card Module: Solely holds insult audio files. Quite a one-trick pony.
Speaker: So the robot can broadcast these files to everyone’s delight…or annoyance.
LM386 amplifier module:For amplifying audio.
Software and Libraries:
Arduino IDE: Minimal coding efforts for minimal output.
Libraries like TMRpcm (because an insult with no sound is no insult at all) and SD (to ensure insults are never in short supply).
4. System Specifications
Microcontroller Specs: Standard enough to carry out minimal tasks without breaking a sweat.
Sensor Range and Accuracy: Just precise enough to detect anyone unlucky enough to be in the area.
Audio Playback: Loud enough to make its pointless statements clearly audible.
Power Specifications: Lasts long enough to ensure the insults keep coming.
Physical Design: Small and easily concealable, for maximum accidental encounters.
